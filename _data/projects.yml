    Developed a feature-enhanced algorithm to deal with pervasive target occlusion, motion blur and fast motion in visual object tracking.
    
    This proposed correlation filter based tracking method aggregates historical features in a spatial-aligned and scale-aware paradigm.
    
    Evaluated this algorithm on benchmark datasets such as OTB and VOT, and achieved leading performance in real-time speed.

    Proposed a tracklet scoring model based on margin loss and rank loss, which provide a clear goal for quantifying tracklet quality. We, for the first time, demonstrate  that  contrastive  learning  can  improve  the  tracklet  consistency  in data association.
    
    Implemented  a  recurrent  search-based  optimization  framework  that  remarkably exposes wrong associations to training. The training process follows a  “searching-learning-ranking-pruning”  pipeline.  It  tackles  the  problem  of  exposure bias existing in sequence modeling that is neglected by previous MOT works.
   
    Implemented multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT) strategies to address the challenging problems of object occluded or missing. Validated on three benchmark datasets of MOT and achieved the state-of-the-art results.
