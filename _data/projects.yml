    Developed a feature-enhanced algorithm to deal with pervasive target occlusion, motion blur and fast motion in visual object tracking.
    
    This proposed correlation filter based tracking method aggregates historical features in a spatial-aligned and scale-aware paradigm.
    
    Evaluated this algorithm on benchmark datasets such as OTB and VOT, and achieved leading performance in real-time speed.

  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Established a sequence encoder based on LSTM to model motion and appearance changing for multiple object tracking.

    Implemented multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT) strategies to address the challenging object occluded or missing.

    Proposed a novel approach to learn global sequence score of each track hypothesis.

    This approach addresses exposure bias and label bias caused by the inconsistent between training and inference in tracking.
